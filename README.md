# ProcessRUsTask

Create an authentication and authorization web API using an identity framework and using an in-app database.

Create 3 identity users called: FrontOffice, BackOffice, and Admin. This application will allow users to log in and generate their JWT token. Add a new controller called AccessController and create a Get method that just spits out an array of fruit types of your choice.

Allow just the Admin and BackOffice roles to access this controller.

The project was done using .NET 7 WebAPI.
